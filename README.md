# Tcp Server

A TCP server implemented in Rust provides a robust and efficient way to handle network communication using the TCP protocol. Rust’s focus on safety, performance, and concurrency makes it an excellent choice for building high-performance network servers.

## Key Components of a TCP Server:

### 1. Listening for Connections:
The server listens for incoming TCP connections on a specified address and port. This is typically done using the TcpListener type from the std::net module.

### 2. Handling Clients:
Once a connection is accepted, the server creates a TcpStream to communicate with the client. This stream is used for reading from and writing to the client.

### 3. Concurrency:
To handle multiple clients simultaneously, Rust’s concurrency features are utilized. This is often achieved using threads or asynchronous programming with the tokio or async-std libraries.

### 4. Error Handling:
Rust’s strong type system and error handling mechanisms ensure that network errors and other issues are managed gracefully, preventing crashes and ensuring reliability.
